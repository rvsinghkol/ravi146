SELinux is a set of security policies/modules which are going to apply on the machine 
to improve the overall security of the machine. These are the Linux security modules(LSM)
 which are loaded in to kernel to improve security on accessing services/files which improve security.
 SELinux is short form of Security Enhanced Linux. SElinux is a security feature which was shipped with RHEL5,
 it is much secure than any other security such as PAM and Initd. Apparmor is some times consider as eloquent 
to SELinux. Below is the security model in Linux

SELinux is set in three modes.

•Enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced. IF this is set SELinux is enabled and will try to enforce the SELinux policies strictly
•Permissive – SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing. This setting will just give warning when any SELinux policy setting is breached
•Disabled – No SELinux policy is loaded. This will totally disable SELinux policies.

mysql -u username -p
Create a new database which will hold all of the data from the data dump and then exit out of the MySQL 
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
exit
Next, we can redirect the dump file into our newly created database by issuing the following command:
mysql -u username -p database_name < backup_name.sql }\\\\

¦Ext2 doesnot have journaling feature.
¦On flash drives, usb drives, ext2 is recommended, as it doesn’t need to do the over head of journaling.
¦Maximum individual file size can be from 16 GB to 2 TB
¦Overall ext2 file system size can be from 2 TB to 32 TB

¦The main benefit of ext3 is that it allows journaling.
¦Maximum individual file size can be from 16 GB to 2 TB
¦Overall ext3 file system size can be from 2 TB to 32 TB
¦You can convert a ext2 file system to ext3 file system directly (without backup/restore).
¦Journaling has a dedicated area in the file system, where all the changes are tracked. 
¦Maximum individual file size can be from 16 GB to 16 TB

¦You can also mount an existing ext3 fs as ext4 fs (without having to upgrade it).
¦In ext4, you also have the option of turning the journaling feature “off”.
¦Overall maximum ext4 file system size is 1 EB (exabyte). 1 EB = 1024 PB (petabyte). 1 PB = 1024 TB (terabyte).

An app server is a software framework. It is dedicated to do one task and includes programs,
 routines, scripts for the the construction of applications. An app server is used to manage business 
logic and works over http, https, gui, webserver and other protocols based clients. Examples of Java application servers 
- JBoss, Apache Geronimo, Weblogic. Zend offers an application server called Zend Serve for PHP applications.
 Zope is another app server written in Python. App servers are complex to design. 

A web server only handles HTTP and HTTPS protocol and used to create html pages only. 
You can use PHP, Python, Perl cgi script for dynamic page generation. Web servers are easy to design.
 Examples of web servers - Apache, lighttpd, IIS, nginx.

 ???? process identifier, a PID is a unique number that identifies each of the
 running processes in an operating system such as Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows.
PID is a unique number that helps identify a hardware product or a registered software product.

An inode is an entry in inode table, containing information ( the metadata ) about a regular file and directory.
An inode is a data structure on a traditional Unix-style file system such as ext3 or ext4.

Hard links share the same inode. Soft links do not.
Hard links can't cross file systems. Soft links do.

#What are the differences between static ip addressing and dynamic ip addressing?
With static IP addressing, a computer (or other device) is configured to always use the same IP address.
 With dynamic addressing, the IP address can change periodically and is managed by a centralized network service.
#What is the DNS forwarder?
DNS servers often must communicate with DNS servers outside of the local network. A forwarder is an entry that is used 
when a DNS server receives DNS queries that it cannot resolve locally. It then forwards those requests to external DNS servers for resolution.
#What are the difference between hub and switch?

Hub is a layer 1 device. It will out the signal from all of its port except the one from where its insert. 
It is unable to detect the collision. It works on single collision and single broadcast domain. 
Switch is layer 2 device. It maintains a CAM table that store the MAC address of devices attached on its port. 
CAM table is used to make the forwarding decision. It works on per port collision and single broadcast domain.





A router is a networking device, commonly specialized hardware, that forwards data packets between computer networks. 
This creates an overlay internetwork, as a router is connected to two or more data lines from different networks.

TCP is a Transmission Control Protocol.UDP is a User Datagram Protocol.
There are four major differences between UDP and TCP:1. TCP can establish a Connection and UDP cannot.
2. TCP provides a stream of unlimited length, UDP sends Small packets.
3.TCP gurantees that as long as you have a connection data sent will arrive at the destination, UDP provides not guarantee delivery.
4.UDP is faster for sending small amounts of data since no connection setup is required, the data can be sent in less time then it takes for TCP to establish a connection.
