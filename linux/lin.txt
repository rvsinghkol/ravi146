What is network bonding in Linux and where the important configuration files involved?
 What is the advantage of Network Bonding ?
#Network Bonding is a Linux kernel feature that allows to aggregate multiple network interfaces into a single virtual link. 
This is a great way to achieve redundant links, fault tolerance or load balancing networks in production system. If one of 
the physical NIC is down or unplugged, it will automatically move traffic to the other NIC card. Similar way 
the bonding will increase the interface throughput to handle the traffic it it is configured in active-active mode.

Setting up 2 IP address on “One” NIC. This example is on ethernet.

####What is the difference between NFSv3 and NFSv4?
 NFS3
 Exports : All exports are mounted separately.
 Communication : One operation per RPC.
 Parallel high bandwidth access : None native. (Addition such as MPFS)
 Locking : Permanent locks in yet another protocol.
  NFS4
 Exports : All exports can be mounted together in a directory tree structure as part of a pseudo-filesystem.
 Communication : Multiple operations per RPC. (Improves performance)
 Parallel high bandwidth access : pNFS
 Locking : Lease based locking in the same protocol.
STEP 1:Setting up first IP address. 
Edit /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 on Redhat Linux box and give the following entries as shown.
 What is drop cache in Linux and how do you clear it ?

#Full Virtualization
Full Virtualization is virtualization in which the guest operating system is unaware that it is in a virtualized environment,
 and therefore hardware is virtualized by the host operating system so that the guest can issue commands to what it thinks is actual hardware, 
but really are just simulated hardware devices created by the host.

Used with full virtualization is a hypervisor such as VMware’s vSphere Hypervisor or Microsoft’s Hyper-V server.
 This hypervisor allows multiple operating systems to run simultaneously on a host computer, while also monitoring the physical server’s 
resources and keeping each virtual server independent of other virtual servers running on the physical machine. Each guest server can run on its
 own operating system, such as both Linux and Windows.

#Para-Virtualization
->The para-virtualization technique offers a software interface to virtual machines that is similar, but not identical to underlying hardware.
 Unlike full server virtualization, guest servers are aware of one another when using para-virtualization. A para-virtualization hypervisor 
does not need large amounts of processing power to manage guest operating systems because of this, as each OS is already aware of the demands 
placed on the physical server.
->Paravirtualization is virtualization in which the guest operating system (the one being virtualized) is aware that it is a guest and accordingly
 has drivers that, instead of issuing hardware commands, simply issue commands directly to the host operating system.

vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0

DEVICE=eth0
BOOTPROTO=static
IPADDR=192.168.1.10
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
NETWORK=192.168.1.0
ONBOOT=yes

STEP 2: Setting up second IP address. Create one file as /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0:1 and give the entries as below in to this file.

vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0:1

DEVICE=eth0:1
BOOTPROTO=static
IPADDR=192.168.1.11
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
NETWORK=192.168.1.0
ONBOOT=yes

An administrator wants to assign an IP address of 192.168.1.10, a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, and a broadcast address of 192.168.1.254 to eth1. What command will accomplish this task?
Following command will do this task

IF /var (file is alrady full showing)

?????////Bring back deleted files with lsof
cat > abcd
less abcd
ls -l abcd
stat abcd
rm abcd
ls -l abcd
Now to bring the file back. First see what lsof has to say about it:
lsof | grep abcd
less      4158    jimbo    4r      REG       3,65   114383   1276722 /home/jimbo/abcd (deleted)

$ ls -l /proc/4158/fd/4
lr-x------  1 jimbo jimbo 64 Oct 31 16:18 /proc/4158/fd/4 -> /home/jimbo/abcd (deleted)
$ cp -a /proc/4158/fd/4 abcd.wrong
$ ls -l abcd.wrong
lrwxr-xr-x  1 jimbo jimbo 24 Oct 31 16:22 myfile.wrong -> /home/jimbo/abcd (deleted)
$ file abcd.wrong
abcd.wrong: broken symbolic link to `/home/jimbo/abcd (deleted)'
$ file /proc/4158/fd/4
/proc/4158/fd/4: broken symbolic link to `/home/jimbo/abcd (deleted)'
So instead of all that, just a plain old cp will do the trick:

$ cp /proc/4158/fd/4 abcd.saved
And finally, verify that you've done good:

$ ls -l abcd.saved
-rw-r--r--  1 jimbo jimbo 114383 Oct 31 16:25 abcd.saved
rename your file.
